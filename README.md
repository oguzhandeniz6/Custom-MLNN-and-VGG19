# Custom-MLNN-and-VGG19
Comparison of custom implemented multi-layer neural network and VGG-19 convolutional neural network algorithms.

In this project, a custom implemented multi-layer neural network is compared with the VGG19 convolutional neural network provided by the PyTorch library. Additionally, concepts such as optimizing neural networks and tuning hyperparameters are explored, and the results are compared.
